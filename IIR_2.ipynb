ramifications involve not only the mechanization itself but also the very significant economically attractive phenomenon of off premises processing it is essential to identify and provide for many legal aspects right now before systems and practices crystallize in order to avoid the later impact of unanticipated physical complications and expense the legal aspects of computerization in the

enormously increases the rate of accessing for drums so defined this is shown to enable a system to perform a job by employing fewer or less expensive drums it is suggested that although the design scheme has a specific use the method underlying it has more general applicability the question of the efficacy of the drum scheme is then raised to deal with this a standard of efficiency is developed in light of realistic realtime circumstances the drum scheme is then modelled in a manner which permits it to be analyzed as a problem in queueing theory thus one is enabled to ascertain whether the

alternative forms of each of these components are described compared and evaluated many examples frequently from list processing languages illustrate the forms described elementary program statements usually take the form of commands requirements or implicit specifications a command is an imperative statement that commands the action to be taken a requirement describes the effect to be achieved without saying anything about the actions to be taken an implicit specification is similar to a requirement but the programmer must understand what actions will be taken to achieve the desired effect subroutines may be entered explicitly by execute call or by function composition explicitly called subroutines generally require special linkage conventions an execute subroutine call is syntactically indistinguishable from a basic instruction of the programming language function composition is a convenient alternative to the explicit call the three principal ways of getting inputs for routines are  by referring to the data itself  by referring to the data by a name and  by referring to it implicitly by means of variables or functions names are useful entry points into permanent data structures

normalization requirement of the divisor in a divideandcorrect method this analysis is made subject to the condition that not more than one correction is required to obtain the true quotient character from the trial estimate got from the division of a twoprecision segment of every partial remainder by a suitably rounded singleprecision divisor this segmented division is denoted here as a   precision basic division it is found that the normalization requirement could be narrowed down to a smaller range of divisors provided the magnitude of the character next to the leading character of the divisor is known if however the normalization is to be eliminated one has to choose proper higher precision segments of operands for the basic division also considered is the possibility of eliminating the normalization by an increase on the number of corrections on the quotient estimate got from a   precision basic division it is shown that such a scheme is economical only for small

part of the aed system this system accepts as input description of the multicharacter items or of words allowable in a language given in terms of a subset of regular expressions the output of the system is a lexical processor which reads a string of characters and combines them into the items as defined by the regular expressions each output item is identified by a code number together with a pointer to a block of storage containing the characters and character count in the item the processors produced by the system are based on finitestate machines each state of a machine corresponds to a unique condition in the lexical processing of a character string at each state a character is read and the machine changes to a new state at each transition appropriate actions are taken based on the particular character read the system has been in operation since  and processors generated have compared favorably in speed to carefully handcoded programs to accomplish the same task lexical processors for aedo and mad are among the many which have been produced the techniques employed are independent of the nature of the items being evaluated if the word events is substituted for character string these processors may be described as generalized decisionmaking mechanisms based upon an ordered sequence of events this allows the system to be used in a range of applications

improper integral of the first kind it is customary to truncate the integral when the change yielded by the last iteration is less than some predetermined constant the efficiency of such integration schemes can often be improved by use of recent advances in the theory of nonlinear transformations however for several important integrals eg integrals whose integrands are rational polynomials these

jb february     am          a simple proof of lewin s orderedretrieval theorem for associative memories an efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary words from an associative memory as described by lewin is based on the use of special readout circuits which indicate the digit values present in the individual digit columns of the memory thus the circuits indicate whether the individual digit columns contain digits of both values or of only one value or contain no digits at all ie that the memory is empty the use of these circuits which in this paper are termed column value indicators reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary to retrieve in order a number of distinct words from the memory lewin proves that for the readout by the described method of m distinct binary words m  memory accesses are necessary thus he proves that the number of necessary memory accesses of his method unlike those of other methods is independent of the word length in this paper a

useful to have a reasonable estimation of the values of s ij where s ij is the mean value of the number of jumps from the ith instruction on to the jth instruction in the run time in the cases where the s ij are estimated directly the structure of the whole program must be generally taken into account therefore it is very difficult for the programmer and or the translator to obtain a good estimation of the s ij it is easier to estimate not s ij but the quantities p ij s ij c i sum s ij j n where c i is an arbitrary positive constant for each i although the p ij are for each i proportional to s ij the estimation of p ij is easier because we must estimate only the probabilities of events where instruction i is executed after instruction i i this estimation can often be done without considering the structure of the whole program in the first part of the paper using the theory of the markov chains an algorithm for the computation of the s ij from the p ij is found and some ways of obtaining estimates of the p ij are given in the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived avoiding the necessity of computation involving large matrices cacm july  kral j object

teachable language comprehender a simulation program and theory of language the teachable language comprehender tlc is a program designed to be capable of being taught to comprehend english text when text which the program has not seen before is input to it it comprehends that text by correctly relating each explicit or implicit assertion of the new text to a large memory this memory is a semantic network representing factual assertions about the world the program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text by this means the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory in this form it can be added into the memory both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory s prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed tlc presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities but within the system notations for expressing either of these are provided thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind the memory structure and comprehension process of tlc allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically that is once such an assertion or capability is put into the system it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future thus the addition of a single factual assertion or linguistic capability will often provide a large increment in tlc s effective knowledge of the world and in its overall ability to comprehend text the program s strategy is presented as a general theory of language comprehension cacm

utilization caused by the inability to make use of all available storage after it has been fragmented into a large number of separate blocks and  internal fragmentation the loss of utilization caused by rounding up a request for storage rather than allocating only the exact number of words required the most striking result is the apparently general rule that rounding up requests for storage to reduce the number of different sizes of blocks coexisting in storage causes more loss of storage by increased internal fragmentation than is saved by decreased external fragmentation described also are a method of segment allocation and an accompanying technique for segment addressing which take advantage of the above result evidence is presented of possible advantages of the method over

a paper  that a file should be organized as a doublychained tree structure if it is necessary both to search and to update frequently such a structure provides a compromise between the fast search slow update characteristics of binary searching and the slow search fast update characteristics of serial searching his method however contains the limiting restriction that all terminal nodes lie on the same level of the tree this paper considers the effect of relaxing this restriction first trees which have the property that a priori the filial set of each node is well defined are studied it is proved that coding the nodes within each filial set with respect to the number of terminal nodes reachable from each is necessary and sufficient to guarantee minimum average search time then the more general case that is where the entire structure of the tree is changeable is treated a procedure is developed for constructing a tree with a minimum average search time a simple closed expression for this minimum average search time is obtained as a function of the number of terminal nodes the storage capacity required to implement the doublychained tree structure on a digital computer is also determined finally the total cost of the structure using sussenguth s cost criterion is computed it is shown that significant improvements in both the average search time and the total cost can be

new hashcoding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hashcoding method the computational factors considered are the size of the hash area space the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set reject time and an allowable error frequency the new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hashcoded information from that associated with conventional methods the reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications in particular applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods in such applications it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and when necessary by using some secondary and perhaps timeconsuming test to catch the small fraction of errors associated with new methods an example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time cacm july  bloom b h hash

is presented for minimizing the sum of the lengths of the blocks of coding produced by an assembler or compiler when  the length of each computer instruction is assumed to be either long or short long

prespecified amounts for example some computers permit either bit addressing interpreted relative to the location counter or full bit addressing of all of memory when assembling or compiling two or more blocks of instructions which have many mutual references in such a computer there is no simple iterative procedure for keeping as many of the addresses short as possible this paper demonstrates

from optimization whereas other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable manner and would not benefit from optimization features not normally

conditions are long overflow chains with significant overflow lack of tight disk space constraints record keys which are small compared to the total record size and significant use of the file in the

however multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information independent of its physical storage location information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege here the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in multics are first

different information structures as list tree ring etc thus the problem of information organization and storage is reduced to that of defining relations and formulating algorithms under a given set of

perseveranceit completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a userestablished error limit is reached this requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution and the design of pl c is dominated by this consideration pl c also introduces several explicit usercontrolled facilities for program testing to accommodate these extensions to pl i without abandoning compatibility with ibm compiler pl c permits pseudo comments constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source test or comment in spite of

computer codes have realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity effectiveness and accuracy of the solutions provided by such codes large scale linear programming codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct solutions without ever having been benchmarked by test problems with known solutions the reason for this failure to adequately test the codes is that rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily available this paper presents a theoretical justification and an illustrative implementation of a method for generating linear programming test problems

       extending the information theory approach to converting limitedentry decision tables to computer programs this paper modifies an earlier algorithm for converting decision tables into flowcharts

optimal solutions however the greater search effort needed to obtain a globally optimal solution for complex decision tables is usually not justified by sufficient savings in execution time there is an analogy between the problem of converting decision tables into efficient flowcharts and the wellunderstood problem in information theory of noiseless coding the results of the noiseless coding literature are used to explore the limitations of algorithms used to solve the decision table problem the analogy between the two problems is also used to develop improvements to the information

store only two vertex values and may begin its processing as soon as the first output vertex from the proceeding stage is ready because the same code is reentered for clipping against subsequent

the distance of the instruction from its target  there exists an optimality criterion which implies some preferential choices subject to the addressing constraints this may be for example achieving

comparisons in the efficiency of decision methods have become available through the developments in complexity theory these however are applications to logic and a big question is whether methods of logic have significance in the other direction for the more applied parts of computability theory programming languages offer an obvious opportunity as their syntactic formalization is well advanced however the semantical theory can hardly be said to be complete though we have many examples we have still to give wideranging mathematical answers to these queries what is a machine what is a computable process how or how well does a machine simulate a process programs naturally enter in giving descriptions of processes the definition of the precise meaning of a program then requires us to explain what are the objects of computation in a way the statics of the problem and how they are to be transformed the dynamics so far the theories of automata and of nets though most in teresting for dynamics have formalized only a portion of the field and there has been perhaps too much concentration on the finitestate and algebraic aspects it would seem that the understanding of higherlevel program features involves us with infinite objects and forces us to pass through several levels of explanation to go from the conceptual ideas to the final simulation on a real machine these levels can be made mathematically exact if we can find the right abstractions to represent the necessary structures the experience of many independent workers with the method of data types as lattices or

reduced throughout the computation all too often the termination functions required are difficult to find and are of a complexity out of proportion to the program under consideration multisets bags over a given wellfounded set s are sets that admit multiple occurrences of elements taken from s the given ordering on s induces an ordering on the finite multisets over s this multiset ordering is

hirschberg and kosaraju which require time o log n moreover the o log n complexity is optimal earlier results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in o log n time thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind where deletion has a smaller time complexity than insertion furthermore it can now be concluded that insertion deletion and retrieval in oshb trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general avl trees to within a
